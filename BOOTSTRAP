Installing rbdlpy:

1. First clone the git repository of NMansard:
git clone https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/rbdlpy.git

2. Copy paste the contents of .git/config file(in the rbdlpy folder of skumar@kitasan) in the new downloaded version of rbdlpy. Delete the previously existing content of the file.

3. Check for the branches: git branch -a

4. git pull nmansard

5. Again check for branches using command of step 3. Now we should see new branch called "topic/skumar".

6. git checkout -b topic/skumar

7. git branch

8. git status

9. git pull

10. Do the cmake and try building the project. It will show the error because rbdl_luamodel.pc and rbdl_urdfreader.pc files are missing.

11. Download these files from the email(sent to Justin once). And put them in /local/skumar/devel/lib/pkgconfig/.

12. Do the cmake again. If it again fails due to cyclic dependency problem, try the step below:

Go to /local/skumar/devel/lib/pkgconfig, and edit the file rbdl.pc by adding lrbdl_urdfreader and lrbdl_luamodel. Build rbdl again and then rbdlpy consequently.

Now everything should work!!
